These MATLAB functions are used to generate various plots from intensity field matrices. These plots can be used to compare intensity fields generated by different simulations with varying input parameters.

 * `centertrace.m` - This function is used to create a plot of depth vs. normalized intensity down the center of the intensity field's lateral-elevation planes. A PNG image of the plot will be created in the current working directory.

 * `contourplots.m` - This function is used to create contour plots of intensity in different planes. Contour lines are drawn at -6 dB, -12 dB, and -18 dB cutoffs. A PNG image of the plots will be created in the current working directory.

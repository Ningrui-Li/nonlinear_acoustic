Field II Simulations - 70 mm Focal Depth
========================================

## Goal
The purpose of these simulations was to compare the intensity fields generated by Field II with the intensity fields generated by KZK sim run in linear mode (β = 0). Any similarities between these intensity fields may provide strong evidence validating the KZK simulation results.

## Methods
Information about the Field II sim run with α = 0.005 dB/cm/MHz (attenuation of water) can be found in `a_0.005`.

Information about the Field II sim run with α = 0.45 dB/cm/MHz can be found in `a_0.45`.

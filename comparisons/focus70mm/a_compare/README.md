70 mm Focus KZK Sim Comparison for Differing α Values
=====================================================
### Goal
Nonlinear acoustic propagation occurs due to sound speed of acoustic waves varying with its current pressure amplitude. At pressure peaks, the sound speed will locally increase, while the sound speed will locally decrease at pressure troughs. It was hypothesized that since nonlinear effects are most prominent for pressure waves with large amplitudes, increasing the attenuation coefficient of the medium will reduce these amplitudes and mitigate the effects of nonlinearity. The goal of these simulations was to estimate an attenuation coefficient where the effects of nonlinearity can be mostly ignored.

### Methods
The KZK sim was run several times for α values of:
 * 0.005 dB/cm/MHz (water)
 * 0.300 dB/cm/MHz
 * 0.450 dB/cm/MHz
 * 1.000 dB/cm/MHz
 * 1.500 dB/cm/MHz
 * 2.000 dB/cm/MHz
 * 2.500 dB/cm/MHz

for nonlinear coefficients of:
 * β = 0
 * β = 3.5
 * β = 7

### Results
#### Center Trace Plots
The center trace plots (intensity as a function of depth at elevation = 0 mm and lateral position = 0 mm) can be seen below for all combinations of attenuation and nonlinear coefficients.

#### Lateral Plane Difference Plots
The difference plots were generated by subtracting the normalized intensity fields of the β = 0 intensity field from the β = 3.5 and β = 7 intensity fields.

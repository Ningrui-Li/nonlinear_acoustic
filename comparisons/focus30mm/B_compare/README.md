KZK Sim - Comparisons Varying β Values
======================================

This script uses the functions in `metrics` to compare the intensity fields generated by the 30 mm focus KZK simulation using different nonlinear coefficients. `B_compare.m` is the MATLAB script that generates the following plots.

The code used to run the 30 mm KZK sim with α = 0.45 dB/cm/MHz and β = 0 can be found in `/luscinia/nl91/nonlinear_acoustic/kzk/field_ii_c52_focus30mm/B_0/a_0.45_B_0`. `c52_30mm_intensity_field_field_ii_pressure_input.mat` contains the intensity field data.

The code used to run the 30 mm KZK sim with α = 0.45 dB/cm/MHz and β = 3.5 can be found in `/luscinia/nl91/nonlinear_acoustic/kzk/field_ii_c52_focus30mm/B_3.5/a_0.45_B_3.5`. `c52_30mm_intensity_field_ii_pressure_input_beta_3.5.mat` contains the intensity field data.

#### Methods
Two different 3D KZK simulations (`try3d_kzk_sim.m`) were run using the same Field II synthesized initial pressure input data (see `/luscinia/nl91/nonlinear_acoustic/kzk/field_ii_c52_focus30mm`) as well as the same attenuation coefficent of α = 0.45 dB/cm/MHz. However, one simulation was run in linear mode with β = 0 while the other one was run with β = 3.5. Each intensity field was normalized and cut into quarters, since the input pressures were created from Field II parameters and were also quarter-symmetric.

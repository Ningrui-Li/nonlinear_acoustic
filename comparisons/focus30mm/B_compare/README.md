KZK Sim - Comparisons Varying β Values
======================================

This script uses the functions in `metrics` to compare the intensity fields generated by the 30 mm focus KZK simulation using different nonlinear coefficients. `B_compare.m` is the MATLAB script that generates the following plots.

The code used to run the 30 mm KZK sim with α = 0.45 dB/cm/MHz and β = 0 can be found in `/luscinia/nl91/nonlinear_acoustic/kzk/field_ii_c52_focus30mm/B_0/a_0.45_B_0`. `c52_30mm_intensity_field_field_ii_pressure_input.mat` contains the intensity field data.

The code used to run the 30 mm KZK sim with α = 0.45 dB/cm/MHz and β = 3.5 can be found in `/luscinia/nl91/nonlinear_acoustic/kzk/field_ii_c52_focus30mm/B_3.5/a_0.45_B_3.5`. `c52_30mm_intensity_field_ii_pressure_input_beta_3.5.mat` contains the intensity field data.

The code used to run the 30 mm KZK sim with α = 0.45 dB/cm/MHz and β = 7 can be found in `/luscinia/nl91/nonlinear_acoustic/kzk/field_ii_c52_focus30mm/B_7/a_0.45_B_7`. `c52_30mm_intensity_field_ii_pressure_input_beta_7.mat` contains the intensity field data.

#### Methods
Three different 3D KZK simulations (`try3d_kzk_sim.m`) were run using the same Field II synthesized initial pressure input data (see `/luscinia/nl91/nonlinear_acoustic/kzk/field_ii_c52_focus30mm`) as well as the same attenuation coefficent of α = 0.45 dB/cm/MHz. However, one sim was run in linear mode with β = 0, another was run with β = 3.5, and the last was with β = 7. Each intensity field was normalized and cut into quarters, since the intensity field had quarter-symmetry due to the input Field II synthesized pressures also having quarter symmetry.

#### Results
### Maximum Intensity
Both intensity fields appeared to be fairly similar. 

The location of maximum intensity for the β = 0 sim was at 0.00 cm in elevation position, 0.00 cm in lateral position, and 3.20 cm in depth position. 

The location of maximum intensity for the β = 3.5 sim was at 0.00 cm in elevation position, 0.00 cm in lateral position, and 3.25 cm in depth position, so both intensity fields had the same max intensity location.

The location of maximum intensity for the β = 3.5 sim was at 0.00 cm in elevation position, 0.00 cm in lateral position, and 3.25 cm in depth position, so both intensity fields had the same max intensity location.

### Center Trace Plot
The center trace plot for the two sims can be seen below.

The intensity was plotted with respect to depth for each sim along the 0 cm lateral position and 0 cm elevational position axis. The intensity was then re-normalized along this axis. The two sims appear to have identical center traces.

### Contour Plots
The contour plane plots for the two KZK sims can be found below in each of the three planes (elevational, lateral, and depth).

Unfortunately, the contour plots also look fairly similar, so they don't provide too much insight into the intensity field differences as the nonlinear coefficient is increased.

##### Elevational Planes

### Differences Plots
## Linear vs. β = 3.5
The two intensity field matrices were subtracted from each other (β = 3.5 field - β = 0 field), and plots were made of the resulting difference matrix in the depth and lateral planes.

These depth plane plots show the greatest difference in intensities at an location that is about 0.13 cm elevationally offset from the center of the plane.

These lateral plane plots show the greatest difference in intensities at an location that is also about 0.13 cm elevationally offset from the center of the plane at a depth of around 2.3 cm.

## Linear vs. β = 7
The above was done to compare the linear simulation with the β = 7 simulation.

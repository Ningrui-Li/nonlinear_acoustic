LS-DYNA Shear Wave Simulation Code
==================================
## Mesh Generation
The `mesh` folder contains information on how the mesh was generated for running the LS-DYNA simulation. The mesh used for the 70 mm focal depth simulation has quarter symmetry, so it is defined from 0 mm to 2.5 mm laterally, -0.6 mm to 0.0 mm in elevation, and it goes from 0 mm to 120 mm in depth. Spacing between nodes is 0.25 mm in all directions.

LS-DYNA Shear Wave Simulation Code
==================================
## Mesh Generation
The `mesh` folder contains information on how the mesh was generated for running the LS-DYNA simulation. The mesh used for the 70 mm focal depth simulation has quarter symmetry, so it is defined from 0 cm to 2.5 cm laterally, -0.6 cm to 0.0 cm in elevation, and 0 cm to 120 cm in depth. Spacing between nodes is 0.025 cm in all directions.

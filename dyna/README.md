LS-DYNA Shear Wave Simulation Code
==================================
## Intensity Field Generation
The intensity field must first be generated by running Field II, KZK, or k-Wave sims. The parameters used for the Field II simulation can be found [here](https://github.com/Ningrui-Li/nonlinear_acoustic/tree/master/field). The Field II synthesized face pressure inputs used for the KZK simulations can be found at `/luscinia/nl91/nonlinear_acoustic/kzk/field_ii_c52_30mm_pressure_input.mat` for the 30 mm focal depth case and `/luscinia/nl91/nonlinear_acoustic/kzk/field_ii_c52_focus70mm/field_ii_c52_70mm_pressure_input.mat` for the 70 mm focal depth case.

## Mesh Generation
The `mesh` folder contains information on how the mesh was generated for running the LS-DYNA simulation. The mesh used for the 30 mm focal depth simulation has quarter symmetry, so it is defined from 0 cm to 1.2 cm laterally, -0.6 cm to 0.0 cm in elevation, and 0 cm to 5.2 cm in depth. The mesh used for the 70 mm focal depth simulation is defined from 0 cm to 2.0 cm laterally, -0.6 cm to 0.0 cm in elevation, and 0 cm to 9.0 cm in depth. For both cases, spacing between axial nodes is 0.025 cm, while spacing between lateral and elevational nodes is 0.020 cm. 

## Running LS-DYNA
In order to use the FEM code to create `loads.dyn`, generated intensity fields must be molded to look like the MAT file output from `field2dyna.m`.
